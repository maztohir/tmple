# tmple
General files or content generator, using **template** and **data/variables**.

> Content of the file will be controlled by the **template** (in [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)), 
and you can control the **template** using **data/variables** (in [Yaml](https://yaml.org/)).
## Use cases
#### 👨‍👩‍👦 Generate simple file, based on a template
Let say you want to generate a repeated SQL file like this:
```sql

WITH 
top_user (SELECT name, phone, address, gender, birth_date FROM top_user LIMIT 10),
mid_user (SELECT name, phone, address, gender, birth_date FROM mid_user LIMIT 10),
low_user (SELECT name, phone, address, gender, birth_date FROM low_user LIMIT 10),
base_user (SELECT name, phone, address, gender, birth_date FROM base_user LIMIT 10)

SELECT * top_user UNION ALL
SELECT * mid_user UNION ALL
SELECT * low_user UNION ALL
SELECT * base_user
```
<sub><sup>**just imagine it has 1000 lines with another repetitive complex query* </sup></sub>😂

Now, what you need to do, is having a template! a Jinja template!
```django
WITH 
{%- for tb in tables %}
{{ tb.name }} AS (SELECT {% for c in columns %}{{ c }}{{ ',' if not loop.last }} {% endfor %}FROM {{ tb.name }} LIMIT {{ tb.limit }}){{ ',' if not loop.last }}
{%- endfor %}
{% for tb in tables %}
SELECT * FROM {{ tb.name }} {{ 'UNION ALL' if not loop.last }}
{%- endfor %}
```
<sub><sup>*Save it to `.jinja2` file to your folder `working_dir/sample.jinja2`*</sup></sub>

But for sure that 👆 template can't generate by it self, it needs a data or variables to work on, right?
Let's just create a yaml file with this format:

```yaml
var: #hold all variables/dictionary that needed in your jinja files
    tables:
        - name: top_user
        limit: 10
        - name: mid_user
        limit: 20
        - name: low_user
        limit: 10
        - name: base_user
        limit: 30

    columns:
        - name
        - phone
        - address
        - gender
        - birth_date

generator:
    - template: sample.jinja2 #where you save your jinja file
      destination:
        - output.sql
        - log # to also print the result on your terminal
```
<sub><sup>*Save it to `.yaml` file to your folder as `working_dir/recipe.yaml`*</sup></sub>
Done! above yaml is what we call `recipe`, for more detail, please take a look here.
Now, lets run your recipe! and see the result!
```bash
cd working_dir

tmple --recipe recipe.yaml
```

Uh oh, you can't run tmple yet? install first man! 😂😂

#### Generate list of files based on multiple templates
When you expect to generate multiple files, you can do setup on the recipe it self!

You can do write to multiple files for the same template, it will generate the same content but in different files
```yaml
var: variables

generator:
    - template: samples/templates/sample.jinja2
      destination:
        - samples/results/sample.sql
        - /Users/personname/folder/tmple/src/results/simple.sql
        - sample/result/log.txt
```

but if let say you need to generate with different template, then do this instead:
```yaml
var: variables

generator:
    - template: samples/templates/sample.jinja2
      destination:
        - samples/results/sample.sql
        - /Users/personname/folder/tmple/src/results/simple.sql
    - template: samples/templates/sample2.jinja2
      destination:
        - samples/results/sample2.sql
    - template: samples/templates/sample3.jinja2
      destination:
        - samples/results/sample3.sql
```
When do this, make sure you have all variables setup in `var:` that needed from all your template.

#### Just print, not generate files
This will generate content from `sample.jinja2` but will not generate a file, it will only do log in your terminal.
You need add `destination:` to generate a file.
```yaml
var: variables

generator:
    - template: samples/templates/sample.jinja2
```

This also only do log/print only
```yaml
var: variables

generator:
    - template: samples/templates/sample.jinja2
      destination: log
```

#### Recipe concept
Recipe is a config file to tell the `tmple` about:
- all the variables that needed in your **templates** (`var:`)
- which template that you gonna use to generate file (`generator:template:`)
- where to save the generated content from your template (`generator:destination:`)


```yaml
var: # mandatory
    any_variable: you need
    you_can:
        - write
        - down
        - here
    and_also:
        it_support: 
            nested: variables!
# above variables it just mentionable in the Jinja files
# like {{ it_also.support.nested }}

extend: # optional
    - samples/recipes/parent_recipe.yaml
    # do inherit
    # all variables or generator written from this parent_recipe.yaml 
    # will be also extended into current recipe
    

generator: # mandatory
    - template: samples/templates/sample.jinja2
      destination:
        - samples/results/sample.sql # directly create a file in this relateve path
        - /Users/personname/folder/tmple/src/results/simple.sql #absolute path to place to some folder
        - log # just print in the log of your terminal

    # you could also generate multiple files in different template using the same variables
    - template: samples/templates/sample2.jinja2
    # if there is no destination key here, then it will only print the generated content
```

## Usage

### Install via pip

### run
Running from repository
